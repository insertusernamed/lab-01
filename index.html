            I actually hate bio class, <em>worst</em> science.
            <br>I was born on the date of my birth and continued to <em>age</em> throughout my life.
            <br>I have amassed an army of <em>goons</em> who follow my every command.
            <br>Together, we like to solve problems that no one has.

        <p style="color:rgb(246 246 246);">Did you know? According to all known laws
            of aviation, there is no way a bee
            should be able to fly.
            Its wings are too small to get
            its fat little body off the ground.
            The bee, of course, flies anyway
            because bees don't care
            what humans think is impossible.
            Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
            Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
            Ooh, black and yellow!

            I enjoy automating mundane tasks so that I have time to do more important things, but usually the things
            <br>I end up automating are pretty useless. Fun nonetheless though for me its like a puzzle. Along with
            <br>my goons, no task is too useless to automate and getting an unfair advantage in something no one cares
            <br>about is our ultimate goal. This is where we reside. (pictured below)
